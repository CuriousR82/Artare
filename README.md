## **Artare** :paintbrush:

Have you ever wondered why there isnt a social media platform for artists?
As an artist myself, I have always wondered that, so I have decided to make one!

#### There are two parts for this project:
1. [<u>APP</u> - :link:](https://github.com/CuriousR82/Artare)
2. [<u>REST API</u> - :link:](https://github.com/CuriousR82/artare-api)


#### For this Project, I have...
- Used **Three.js** to form the scene, and **Cannon.js** as the 3D physics engine to animate the character and the events
- Worked with **Blender** to model the 3D main character, and created **animations** using the Action Editor tool
- Delivered **smooth gameplay** to users by using multiple types of cameras and position methods in **Three.js**

#### Let's look at the game first!
##### Brief overview of the game:
- The game consists of one player, and a bridge with **10 strong** glasses, and **10 fragilent** glasses. 
- To win the game, you will need to jump on 10 strong glasses in a row! :sunglasses:

Below is the starting scene of the game. You can **drag**, **zoom**, or **press shift and drag** to customize your view. :laughing:
