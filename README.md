## **Artare** :paintbrush:

Have you ever wondered why there isnt a social media platform for artists?
As an artist myself, I have always wondered that, so I have decided to make one!

#### There are two parts for this project:
1. [<u>APP</u> - :link:](https://github.com/CuriousR82/Artare)
2. [<u>REST API</u> - :link:](https://github.com/CuriousR82/artare-api)


#### For this Project, I have...
- Implemented a social media app with the **MVVM architecture** for artists to share their thoughts and creations on each otherâ€™s works
- Developed a **REST API** with **Bcrypt.js** to securely manage and perform **HTTP requests** with data validation/transformation, and encryption
- Delivered high-quality art attachments using **Sharp** and **Multer**, up to **100 MB** in size
- Incorporated smooth **animations** on gestures and **light and dark modes** for a more engaging user interaction

#### Let's look at Artare!
Here is the register page that new users will first encounter :relieved:

If user is not new to Artare, they can log in with the [Log in]() button on the welcome page :eyes:

This is what the main components of Artare looks like!
There is the home page where users can view other users posts, slide menu that operates both on tap of the hamburger icon and slide gesture, and the posting page. :blush:

The profile view looks like this :sleepy:

Here are pages such as search, notifications, and messages!

Finally, this is the dark mode version of Artare!
