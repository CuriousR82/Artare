## **Artare** :paintbrush:

Have you ever wondered why there isnt a social media platform for artists?
As an artist myself, I have always wondered that, so I have decided to make one!

#### There are two parts for this project:
1. [<u>APP</u> - :link:](https://github.com/CuriousR82/Artare)
2. [<u>REST API</u> - :link:](https://github.com/CuriousR82/artare-api)


#### For this Project, I have...
- Implemented a social media app with the **MVVM architecture** for artists to share their thoughts and creations on each otherâ€™s works
- Developed a **REST API** with **Bcrypt.js** to securely manage and perform **HTTP requests** with data validation/transformation, and encryption
- Delivered high-quality art attachments using **Sharp** and **Multer**, up to **100 MB** in size
- Incorporated smooth **animations** on gestures and **light and dark modes** for a more engaging user interaction

#### Let's look at Artare!
Here is the register page that new users will first encounter :relieved:<br><img src="/readme_pics/register.png"  width="500">

If user is not new to Artare, they can log in with the "Log in" button on the welcome page :eyes:<br><img src="/readme_pics/login.png"  width="500">

This is what the main components of Artare looks like! :blush:

The profile view looks like this :sleepy: <br><img src="/readme_pics/profile.png"  width="500">

Here are pages such as search, notifications, and messages!

Finally, this is the dark mode version of Artare!

#### In the works... :hammer_and_wrench:
Here are some pictures of me testing the API with **Studio 3T** and **Postman**!
